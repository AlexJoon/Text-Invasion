# Text-Invasion

Asteroid Text-Matching game made with the Zelle Graphics library and Python language.

Starting the program, the player is prompted to input their name that will be later recorded into a .txt file for their score.

Player is given an entry box to match the words that are falling down from the screen in a certain amount of time until they reach the point of gameover. After every row of words, 5 new randomly indexed words will appear and the player will have to keep matching and increment scorepoints for the row. 

The word's velocity increases faster as the player increments more score points by completing rows of words. When the game is over, the player's score is recorded in a .txt file and a simple conversion is also put into the .txt file to tell how many WPM they were doing from matching each word in the game.
